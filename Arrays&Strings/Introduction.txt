Introduction

Array is one of the fundamental blocks in data structure. Since a string is just formed by an array of characters, they are both similar. Most interview questions fall into this category.

In this card, we will introduce array and string. After finishing this card, you should:

    Understand the differences between array and dynamic array;
    Be familiar with basic operations in the array and dynamic array;
    Understand multidimensional arrays and be able to use a two-dimensional array;
    Understand the concept of string and the different features string has;
    Be able to apply the two-pointer technique to practical problems.
Introduction to Array

In this chapter, we are going to introduce two important concepts: array and dynamic array.

These are the basic data structure you should be familiar with. We also provide a tutorial for you to use the built-in array and dynamic array.

By completing this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

    What is the difference between array and dynamic array?
    What is the corresponding built-in data structure of array and dynamic array in your frequently-used language?
    How to perform basic operations (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, etc) in an array?
    How to perform basic operations (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, addition, deletion, etc) in a dynamic array?
